Crafting a distributed bank account simulation system using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) offers a compelling exploration into distributed computing. With this project, we delve into the world of finance and technology, simulating bank account operations across distributed nodes. Through Java RMI, we enable seamless communication between these nodes, demonstrating the power and versatility of remote method invocation in building robust, distributed systems.
